              <h2>boy is 2hollis's 3rd studio album. Following the two singles, "light" and "crush" it released on June 7th of 2024. Hollis chose this name due to the albums qoute, "coming of age" feel. He added in an interview with Complex, "like, my life is as a boy... ...this is me.". The songs represent the  up's and down's that come in life... One such "down" is heard at the ending of, 'you one said my name for the last time', where he says, "I won't say your name, say your name
for the first time" saying he's forgetting about the girl he loved, you then hear 2 leaving the recording booth. the song ends with a door closing.</h2>

       <h3>This is definitely one of if not my favorite album of all time. Every single song hits so hard (except say it). One of my highlights happens on the first song, "you once said my name for the first time at 2:59 minutes in when beat drops, genuinely the most hype i've ever gotten listening to a song. Although 2hllis says its one of the weakest songs on the album I believe, 'promise' is one of the strongest songs he's released.</h3>
