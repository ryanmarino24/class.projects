              <h2>2 is 2hollis's second studio album. Following the three singles, "PLASTER", "Forfeit", and "GOD" 2 was dropped on May 11th 2023. 2 features 11 songs from all 2's to it will never be the same. Not much is known about the making of 2. All Hollis said the day he dropped it was, "world wiped.. god trust.. all 2wos.. lord"</h2>

       <h3>2 is also one of my favorite albums, the way the songs blend into each other is crazy. Like GOD into trust into FORFEIT and blackbirds into fame runner. This is one of those albums that you could turn on at any time. I remember my first listen a year ago it definitely changed me, and I know that sounds lame, because it is, but thats besides the point. Every song on this album is great. I think it will never be the same has the best replay value of any 2hollis song yet.</h3>
