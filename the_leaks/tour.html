               <p>20th of January, 2025, 7:00 PM, Atlanta Georgia, The Masquerade. Matthew, Tommy, Kirklin, and I. We had parked atleast 5 minutes from The Masquerade. There was a polar vortex that caused the temperature to be under 32°. I thought I was going to be okay wearing a short-sleeved shirt. I had to run back to the car after getting to The Masquerade to get my jacket. Once we got in there, there was a ton of people. About 25 minutes after we got in, Nate Sib came out and performed. Then after, 2hollis came out. It was so hype, 100% the craziest night of my life.</p>
