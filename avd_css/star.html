             <h3>what is 'star'</h3> 
            <h2>"You are now witness to something great, do you get" star is 2hollis's fourth studio album. Following the singles, "afraid" and "style". Star released on April 4th 2025. Star was recorded in the burned remains of Hollis's childhood home that was burnt in the LA fires of January 2025. The reason for the name according to Hollis was, "the only thing to survive (the fire) was “The star”. my mother had it framed.. i knew it was destiny." He added, "burn was one of the last songs finished.. the next day we had to evacuate."</h2>

       <h3>I believe that star is a great album, but it could've been so much better. The emotion and story of the album makes you resonate with the album, but then you have songs like cope and girl which feel pretty lacluster. Yet then theres other songs such as safe and destroy me (which is going to be in the new skate game.) One of the greatest things about this album, like in 2 and boy are the transitions. Beginning into flash as well as ego into sidekick are some of the hardest transitions 2Hollis has done. </h3>
